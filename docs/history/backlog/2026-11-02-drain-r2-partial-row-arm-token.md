Status: open
Priority: Low (non-blocking r2 residual; lands as a follow-up tidy)
Severity: Low
Origin: code review r2 of plan `docs/history/plans/2026-11-01-docs-tmp-retention-redesign.md` (documentation#partial-would-drain-row-missing-arm-token).

## Direction

The arm-3 partial-verdict reason carries no arm token, so a partial+report-only would-drain row shows posture but not arm, contrary to the SKILL sentence. Add the arm token to the partial reason string (and a partial+report-only fixture).
